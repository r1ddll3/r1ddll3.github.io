# Chicken - REverse-Engineering
#### =====================



>Description: So I tried learning a new sorta-language, but I'm not very good at it and don't think I used it right. Can you check for me?


Challenge is a file named **chicken.chn** i opened it in VSCode

![!\[\[chickenwords.png\]\]](https://i.imgur.com/7MvVZUG.png)

   Opps, i don't know what is this chicken lol?..

   so google is my friend atm, after searching in different ways i found that chicken esolang known as (shockingly) [Reference](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Chicken).

   each line has the word "chicken" written a certain number of times.

   and that means when count the number of chicken on each line you will

   get a something called opcode Nvm Skip this part let's get into our missions

  

 1. i searched for tool that can translate those lines to me

   automatically and i found a tool on github:

   [GithubTool](https://github.com/kosayoda/chickenpy)

![!\[\[Capture.png\]\]](https://i.imgur.com/VrNPPBf.png)

  it translates the lines to be easier to read after i ran the tool and

  got the result it was kinda easy to me now to read it and extract the flag

	chickenpy.VM - Storing 'b' to 37

	chickenpy.VM - Storing '{' to 6

	chickenpy.VM - Storing 'e' to 28

	chickenpy.VM - Storing 'b' to 0


Hmm, i noticed that every number represents a letter for example: 

    chickenpy.VM - Storing 'b' to 0

    storing 'b' to 0, so index number 0
    
    is representing letter 'b'
    
	and so on like indexing in array we count from 0


 i started to combine them from index `0` to the last index
 
so since i start counting from `0` i will see if `0` matches the letter `b` cuz  the flag is always starts with letter `b`  and the flag pattern is `byuctf{answer...}` so if yes i will keep going to the next index and it matches letter `y` that means i am on the right track cuz next letter in the flag is `y`, i hope you understand this part xd

 once i done collected the flag i submitted it but it said wrong flag

 ~~byuctf{th3r3_4r3_3ven_w01s3_es0l4ngs_but_1m_lazzy}~~

 i asked the support and they told me
 
 `w01s3` not a word so i thought to replace the numbers with their
 
 normal letters and translate it on google like this 
 
 {there_are_even_woise_esolengs_but_im_lazzy} to see the meaning and
 
to be able to know the correct word for `w01s3`
and i found out the correct one is  `w0rs3`

 so i edited my flag and submitted it and 

Bingo!! i got chicken Challenge

> FLAG: byuctf{th3r3_4r3_3ven_w0rs3_es0l4ngs_but_1m_lazzy}

Thanks For REading..
